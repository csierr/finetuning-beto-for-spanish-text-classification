# ðŸš€ finetuning-beto-for-spanish-text-classification ðŸ‡ªðŸ‡¸

This project demonstrates the process of fine-tuning the BETO model (a BERT-based model for Spanish) for text classification tasks. The notebook covers the training and validation steps, with a focus on obtaining the best model based on validation loss. Once the model is fine-tuned, the goal is to integrate it into a local Flask application for a more complete development cycle.

This project serves as a simple yet effective starting point for learning how to work with transformer models.

I hope you find it helpful or interesting. Feel free to clone and adapt it to your own projects!
